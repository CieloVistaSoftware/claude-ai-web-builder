## Overview

The Claude AI Website Builder is a user-friendly, mathematically-designed website builder that enables users to create beautiful, responsive websites without coding knowledge. The system uses golden ratio design principles, a modern design system, and reusable components to ensure professional results.

## Features

- **Easy Customization**: Customize colors, fonts, content, and images with our intuitive step-by-step wizard.
- **Mobile Responsive**: All websites are automatically optimized for mobile devices and tablets.
- **Download & Deploy**: Download your complete website as a ZIP file or deploy directly to GitHub Pages.
- **Mathematical Design**: All design elements follow the golden ratio for naturally appealing proportions.

- `/components` - Reusable components (core, table, theme, UI, web)
- `/html` - Pure HTML files (layouts, pages, components)
- `/themes` - Theme-related files and components
- `/css` - Global and theme-specific CSS files
- `/src` - TypeScript source files
