## 🚫 ABSOLUTE RULES

### Rule #1: NO MODIFICATIONS WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER REQUEST
- User must say: "Change [specific file]"
- User must say: "Fix [specific problem]"
- User must say: "Update [specific feature]"

### Rule #2: NO "IMPROVEMENTS"
- Don't "optimize"
- Don't "refactor"
- Don't "clean up"
- Don't "reorganize"
- Don't "enhance"

### Rule #3: IF IT WORKS, DON'T TOUCH IT
- Working code is sacred
- Ugly working code > Beautiful broken code
- Leave it alone unless explicitly asked

---

## ✅ What IS Allowed

### User explicitly requests:
- ✅ "Add a toggle for static backgrounds"
- ✅ "Fix the bug where X doesn't work"
- ✅ "Change the documentation to say Y"
- ✅ "Add feature Z"

### These phrases mean DO IT:
- "Change..."
- "Fix..."
- "Add..."
- "Update..."
- "Modify..."

---

## ❌ What is NOT Allowed

### Without explicit request:
- ❌ Touching any locked file
- ❌ "Improving" code structure
- ❌ "Optimizing" performance
- ❌ "Cleaning up" style
- ❌ "Refactoring" architecture
- ❌ "Updating" dependencies
- ❌ "Enhancing" features

### These phrases mean STOP:
- "I could improve..."
- "Let me optimize..."
- "I notice this could be better..."
- "I'll clean this up..."
- "Let me refactor..."

---

## 📋 Current Working State

### Theme Switching: ✅ WORKING
```javascript
// applyTheme() function calculates all 15 colors:
// - Primary (base hue)
// - Secondary (+180°)
// - Accent (-30°)
// - Highlight (+45°)
// - All plus/minus angles
```

### Nav Menu: ✅ WORKING
```javascript
// initNavButtons() handles:
// - Mode switching (dark/light)
// - View switching (code/docs)
// - Theme selection (16 themes)
```

### Documentation: ✅ WORKING
```javascript
// loadDocumentation() renders markdown
```

---

## 🔔 Before ANY Change

**MUST ASK:**
```
⚠️ You want me to modify [filename]?
📝 This will change: [specific description]
❓ Should I proceed? (WAIT FOR YES/NO)
```

**NEVER ASSUME:**
- That a change is needed
- That "better" code is worth breaking things
- That refactoring helps
- That optimization matters more than working code

---

## 💾 Backup Protocol

**IF user explicitly approves a change:**

1. Create backup first:
```
[filename].backup-2025-01-18-2345
```

2. Make the ONE requested change

3. Stop and let user test

4. Don't touch anything else

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**These files are LOCKED because:**
- ✅ Theme switching works
- ✅ Nav buttons work
- ✅ Colors change correctly
- ✅ All 15 colors update
- ✅ View switching works
- ✅ Mode switching works
- ✅ Documentation loads

**DO NOT BREAK WHAT WORKS**

1. Leave it alone (recommended)
2. Make a specific change (tell me exactly what)

What would you like?
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong Today:
1. Modified working files without permission
2. "Improved" code that didn't need improving
3. Broke working features
4. Made user waste time
5. Lost user's confidence

### What Should Have Happened:
1. Asked first
2. Made minimal changes
3. Tested before claiming "ready"
4. Respected working code

## 🔐 THE GOLDEN RULE

**IF IT WORKS, DON'T TOUCH IT**

No exceptions.  
No "but I could make it better."  
No "let me just..."

**LOCKED MEANS LOCKED.**
