# Image Saving Instructions

## 📁 Folder Structure Created

✅ `C:\Users\jwpmi\Downloads\AI\wb\images\article\` - Ready for your screenshots!

## 📸 How to Save Your Images

### Manual Method (Recommended):

Since I cannot directly save image files from our chat, please follow these steps:

1. **Save each image from this chat:**
   - Right-click each image in the chat
   - Select "Save Image As..."
   - Navigate to: `C:\Users\jwpmi\Downloads\AI\wb\images\article\`

2. **Use these filenames:**

```
Image 1 (Blue/Magenta/Cyan) → harmony-complementary-magenta.png
Image 2 (Blue/Orange/Green) → harmony-analogous-warm.png
Image 3 (Blue/Purple variations) → harmony-analogous-blue.png
Image 4 (Blue/Magenta/Cyan v2) → harmony-split-complementary.png
Image 5 (Blue monochrome) → harmony-analogous-tight.png
Image 6 (All blue) → harmony-monochromatic-blue.png
```

## 📋 Suggested Naming Convention:

### For your current images:
- `harmony-complementary-magenta.png` - Complementary with magenta accent
- `harmony-analogous-warm.png` - Analogous with warm colors
- `harmony-analogous-blue.png` - Tight blue analogous
- `harmony-split-complementary.png` - Split complementary variation
- `harmony-analogous-tight.png` - Very close analogous
- `harmony-monochromatic-blue.png` - Single hue variations

### For the HCS Showcase:
- `hcs-theme-showcase.png` - The main UI demonstration

### For future captures:
- `harmony-comparison-grid.png` - All 9 modes in one grid
- `modulation-engine-demo.gif` - Animated modulation
- `audio-reactive-demo.mp4` - Audio visualization

## 🔧 Alternative: Screenshot Tool

If you want to re-capture the images directly from your browser:

1. Open the demo file that generated these screenshots
2. Use these settings for consistency:
   - Base Hue: 240° (blue)
   - Saturation: 70%
   - Lightness: 50%
3. Capture each harmony mode
4. Save with the naming convention above

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After saving, verify:
- [ ] All 6 images saved
- [ ] Filenames follow convention
- [ ] All in `wb\images\article\` folder
- [ ] Images are clear and readable
- [ ] PNG format (for best quality)

## 📝 Next Steps After Saving

Once images are saved, I can:
1. Update article with correct image paths
2. Create an image index document
3. Generate HTML gallery page
4. Create social media versions

## 🎯 Quick Command (Windows)

Open File Explorer to the folder:
```
explorer "C:\Users\jwpmi\Downloads\AI\wb\images\article"
```

Then drag and drop your images from the chat into this folder!

**Note:** I've created the folder structure. You'll need to manually save the images from our chat conversation into this location. Let me know once they're saved and I can help with the next steps!
