WebComponents are smaller reusable parts
They will have four files 
xyz.html, 
xyz.css., 
xyz.js and a 
xyz.readme.md 
the xyz is the component name and follows from the .html file name.
They will have a folder components/folder name where the folder name is the comopnent name
No html file can have .css or .javascript.  It must be extracted from the .html file. 
All components are found in the folder themes/components.
