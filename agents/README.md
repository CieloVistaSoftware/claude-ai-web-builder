# Agents Folder

This folder is for automation agents and scripts that monitor, test, and maintain your project.

## Example Agent Workflows
- Automatically run and fix tests after code changes
- Monitor file changes and trigger builds
- Synchronize data or resources
- Start/stop MCP servers or other services

Add your agent scripts here (e.g., test-fixer-agent.js, build-watcher.ps1, etc.) to keep your workspace organized.
