- 🆕 Refactored `wb-base-demo.html` to use dynamic Markdown loading. Removed hardcoded documentation and switched to `<wb-demo markdown="./wb-base.md">` pattern. This standardizes documentation loading and improves maintainability.
- 🆕 Created `wb-base.css` for naming consistency. All base/component CSS files now follow the naming convention and are easy to discover/import.
