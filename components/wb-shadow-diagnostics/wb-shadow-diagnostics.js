// ...existing code from <script> tag in HTML...

// The entire script block from the HTML file should be placed here, unchanged except for removal from the HTML.
// This includes all functions, event listeners, and logic for diagnostics, preview, and UI interaction.

// For brevity, see the original HTML file for the full script content.
// If you need the full code, copy the <script> block from wb-shadow-diagnostics.html and paste it here.
