# claude.md for wb-color-harmony

## 2025-10-14
- Created `wb-color-harmony` component for visualizing a color harmony palette.
- Component follows project guide: new component must have a claude.md log, README, and be documented in the folder.
- Usage: Accepts a `palette` array (with name, hue, saturation, lightness) and renders swatches.
- Integration: Designed to work with `wb:color-harmony-change` events from color bar components.

## TODO
- Add more visual options (labels, hex, etc.)
- Add tests and demo page
