## Activity Log

### 2025-10-10  (Most Recent First)

- ✅ Component is reactive. Issue was integration: index.html was not wrapping content in <wb-layout> tags. Updated HTML, replaced placeholder image, and switched to wb-nav custom element. Confirmed Proxy-based state management and automatic UI updates.
- ✅ Demo converted to wb-demo component. Standardized two-tab layout, added live layout switching, event logging, and responsive behavior demonstration.
- ✅ Demo rebuilt and loading errors fixed. Rebuilt HTML, fixed paths, added missing config files, and ensured all components load and style correctly.
