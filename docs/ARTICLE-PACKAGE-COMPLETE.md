🌊 What if we applied radio wave theory to color design?

I just built a Wave-Based Color Harmony system that treats color as a wave phenomenon—combining traditional color theory with concepts like:

• Phase Modulation (PM)
• Frequency Modulation (FM)  
• Harmonic Series
• Doppler Shift
• Beat Patterns

The results? Color palettes that are mathematically harmonious, perceptually pleasing, and dynamically adaptable.
