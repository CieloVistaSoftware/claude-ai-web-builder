# Wave-Based Color Harmony: Complete Visual Showcase

## 🎨 Harmony Mode Comparison

The Wave-Based Color Harmony system offers **9 distinct harmony modes**—combining traditional color theory with innovative wave-based approaches.

## 📊 Traditional Color Theory Modes

### 1. **Complementary** (180°)
![Complementary Harmony](../images/article/harmony-complementary.png)

**Theory:** Colors directly opposite on the color wheel  
**Wave Analogy:** Phase opposition—waves 180° out of phase  
**Use Case:** Maximum contrast, vibrant designs

**Example:**
- Primary: Blue (240°)
- Accent: Orange (60°)
- Result: Bold, high-energy palette

---

### 2. **Split Complementary**
![Split Complementary Harmony](../images/article/harmony-split-complementary.png)

**Theory:** Base color + two colors adjacent to its complement  
**Wave Analogy:** Near-opposition with harmonic neighbors  
**Use Case:** High contrast with more nuance than pure complementary

**Example:**
- Primary: Blue (240°)
- Secondary: Yellow-Orange (45°)
- Accent: Red-Orange (15°)
- Result: Dynamic trio with visual tension

---

### 3. **Triadic** (120°)
![Triadic Harmony](../images/article/harmony-triadic.png)

**Theory:** Three colors evenly spaced around the wheel  
**Wave Analogy:** Three-phase system—like electrical power  
**Use Case:** Balanced, vibrant palettes

**Example:**
- Primary: Blue (240°)
- Secondary: Red (0°)
- Accent: Yellow (120°)
- Result: Primary color harmony

---

### 4. **Tetradic** (90°)
![Tetradic Harmony](../images/article/harmony-tetradic.png)

**Theory:** Four colors in two complementary pairs  
**Wave Analogy:** Quadrature—90° phase relationships  
**Use Case:** Rich, complex designs with many options

**Example:**
- Primary: Blue (240°)
- Secondary: Orange (60°)
- Accent: Yellow-Green (150°)
- Tertiary: Red-Purple (330°)
- Result: Four-color system with maximum variety

---

### 5. **Analogous** (±30°)
![Analogous Harmony](../images/article/harmony-analogous.png)

**Theory:** Colors adjacent on the wheel  
**Wave Analogy:** Similar frequencies—minimal interference  
**Use Case:** Calm, cohesive designs

**Example:**
- Primary: Blue (240°)
- Secondary: Blue-Purple (270°)
- Accent: Blue-Cyan (210°)
- Result: Smooth, harmonious gradient

---

## 🌊 Wave Theory Modes

### 6. **Beat Pattern**
![Beat Pattern Harmony](../images/article/harmony-beat-pattern.png)

**Theory:** When two waves of slightly different frequencies combine, they create periodic variations in amplitude—"beats"  
**Formula:** `f_beat = |f1 - f2|`  
**Color Application:** Colors at nearly identical hues create subtle visual rhythms

**Example:**
- Base Hue: 240°
- Colors: 240°, 245°, 250°, 255°
- Result: Gentle color oscillation that feels natural

**Why It Works:**
Just like musical beats help you tune instruments, color beats create subtle variations that feel harmonious yet interesting.

---

### 7. **Harmonic Series** 🎵
![Harmonic Series Harmony](../images/article/harmony-harmonic-series.png)

**Theory:** Musical harmony comes from integer frequency ratios (1:2:3:4). Applied to hue angles.  
**Formula:** `hue_n = base_hue + (360° × n / 6)` where n = 1, 2, 3, 4  
**Color Application:** Creates naturally balanced palettes

**Example:**
- Fundamental: 240° (Blue)
- 1st Harmonic: 300° (Magenta) - 2:1 ratio
- 2nd Harmonic: 0° (Red) - 3:1 ratio  
- 3rd Harmonic: 60° (Orange) - 4:1 ratio
- Result: "Musical" color chord

**Why It Works:**
Your brain recognizes harmonic relationships across sensory modalities. These ratios feel "in tune."

---

### 8. **Doppler Shift** 🚀
![Doppler Shift Harmony](../images/article/harmony-doppler.png)

**Theory:** Moving wave sources create frequency shifts—higher when approaching, lower when receding  
**Formula:** `f_observed = f_source × (1 + v/c)`  
**Color Application:** Smooth hue transitions in one direction

**Example:**
- Base: 240° (Blue)
- Shifted: 225°, 210°, 195°, 180° (toward cyan)
- Result: Directional color progression

**Why It Works:**
Creates natural-feeling gradients, perfect for motion graphics and transitions.

### 9. **Standing Wave** 🌀
![Standing Wave Harmony](../images/article/harmony-standing-wave.png)

**Theory:** When waves reflect and interfere, they create stable patterns with nodes and antinodes  
**Formula:** Fixed points at `λ/2` intervals  
**Color Application:** Evenly distributed hues create stable, balanced palettes

**Example:**
- Base: 240°
- Nodes: 240°, 120°, 0°, 240° (repeating pattern)
- Result: Perfectly balanced triadic system

**Why It Works:**
Even distribution creates visual stability and balance—no single color dominates.

## 🔬 The Science Behind Wave-Based Modes

### Why Apply Radio Theory to Color?

1. **Electromagnetic Continuum**
   - Radio waves: ~1 MHz - 1 GHz
   - Visible light: ~430-770 THz
   - Same physics, different frequency!

2. **Perceptual Mathematics**
   - Humans perceive logarithmic relationships
   - Harmonic ratios feel natural
   - Wave interference creates patterns we recognize

3. **Cross-Modal Transfer**
   - Your brain processes patterns similarly across senses
   - Musical harmony principles apply to visual harmony
   - Wave math is universal

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Combining Modes
Don't limit yourself to one mode! Layer approaches:
- **Base:** Analogous for smooth foundation
- **Accent:** Complementary for contrast
- **Highlight:** Beat Pattern for subtle variation

### Modulation Engine
All modes work with the modulation engine:
- **PM (Phase):** Shifts hue over time
- **FM (Frequency):** Varies rate of change
- **AM (Amplitude):** Pulses saturation
- **Combined:** All three at once!

### Audio Reactive
Let music drive the harmony:
- Bass → Hue shifts
- Mids → Saturation
- Treble → Lightness

## 📸 Capturing These Examples

To generate your own comparison images:

1. Open `wb-color-harmony-demo.html`
2. Set base hue (e.g., 240° for blue)
3. Observe all 9 harmony cards
4. Capture screenshots of each mode
5. Create comparison grid

**Pro Tip:** Use the same base hue for all captures to show how each mode interprets the same starting point differently!

## 🎬 Next: See It In Motion

Static images show the modes, but the real magic happens with:
- **Modulation Engine:** Colors evolve over time
- **Cascade Effect:** Waves ripple through swatches
- **Audio Reactive:** Music drives color changes

See the [Modulation Guide](./modulation-engine-guide.md) for details!
