# Claude Report: Work Needed for All Reports in docs/reports

## BATCH-CONVERSION-FINAL-REPORT.md
- Check status of wb-color-bars and additional components (marked as 'Check needed' and 'In progress').
- Confirm all components are standardized and update the table for any missing or incomplete conversions.

## BATCH-CONVERSION-REPORT.md
- Review and update the list of completed components as more are standardized.
- Ensure all components have dual exports and global exposure as described.
- Add new components to the report as they are converted.

## COMPONENT-INHERITANCE-AUDIT.md
- Refactor 33 components to extend WBBaseComponent instead of HTMLElement.
- Update audit results as refactors are completed.
- Confirm utility components and those already correct remain up-to-date.

## DOCUMENTATION-STATUS-REPORT.md
- Create missing .md documentation files for components listed as missing (e.g., wb-btn.md, wb-color-picker.md).
- Update the report as new documentation files are added.
- Ensure all components have up-to-date and complete documentation.

---

**General To-Do:**
- Regularly update all reports as work progresses.
- Add new components and documentation status as needed.
- Ensure all audit and conversion reports reflect the current state of the codebase.
