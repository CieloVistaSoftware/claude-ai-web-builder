# 🚀 Quick Start - Claude.md Change Detection

**For Developers & AI Assistants**

---

## 📋 Daily Workflow

### 1. Check Status (Start of Day)
```bash
npm run check-status
```
or
```powershell
.\scripts\check-claude-status.ps1
```

**Output**: Shows how many files need aggregation

---

### 2. Aggregate Changes (When Needed)
**Tell AI**: "Aggregate changed claude.md files"

**AI will**:
- Read all NEW and UPDATED files
- Update currentstatus.md
- Mark processed files as READ
- Report what changed

---

### 3. Mark File After Editing
```bash
npm run mark-updated -- -FilePath "./components/wb-input/claude.md"
```
or
```powershell
.\scripts\mark-claude-updated.ps1 -FilePath "components\wb-input\claude.md"
```

**Or manually**: Add to top of file:
```markdown
<!-- STATUS: UPDATED -->
```

---

## 🎯 Status Markers

Add ONE of these to the FIRST LINE of every claude.md file:

```markdown
<!-- STATUS: NEW -->      🔴 New file, never aggregated
<!-- STATUS: UPDATED -->  🟡 Has changes, needs re-aggregation  
<!-- STATUS: READ -->     ✅ Current, no action needed
<!-- STATUS: ARCHIVED --> ⚫ Old/deprecated, skip
```

---

## 🔧 First Time Setup

### Step 1: Initialize All Files
```bash
npm run init-markers
```

This adds `<!-- STATUS: READ -->` to all existing claude.md files

### Step 2: Verify
```bash
npm run check-status
```

Should show all files as READ

### Step 3: Do Full Aggregation
**Tell AI**: "Force full claude.md refresh"

This creates the initial currentstatus.md

---

## 💻 AI Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| "Check claude.md status" | Show file counts by status |
| "Aggregate changed claude.md files" | Update currentstatus.md from changed files |
| "Mark [component] claude.md as updated" | Mark file for next aggregation |
| "Force full claude.md refresh" | Rebuild from ALL files (slow) |

---

## 📝 Editing Workflow

### When You Edit a claude.md File:

1. **Edit the file** - Make your changes
2. **Mark as UPDATED** - Change first line to `<!-- STATUS: UPDATED -->`
3. **Next aggregation** - File will be processed
4. **After processing** - AI marks it as `<!-- STATUS: READ -->`

### Example:

**Before editing**:
```markdown
<!-- STATUS: READ -->
# Component claude.md
...
```

**After editing**:
```markdown
<!-- STATUS: UPDATED -->
# Component claude.md

## NEW CONTENT - October 19, 2025
- Fixed issue XYZ
...
```

**After aggregation** (AI does this):
```markdown
<!-- STATUS: READ -->
# Component claude.md

## NEW CONTENT - October 19, 2025
- Fixed issue XYZ
...
```

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Mark file as UPDATED after every edit
- Run check-status daily
- Aggregate changes before major work
- Use descriptive status updates

### ❌ DON'T:
- Forget to mark files as UPDATED
- Skip the first-line marker
- Edit currentstatus.md directly (let AI aggregate)
- Mark trivial typo fixes as UPDATED

---

## 🔍 Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: I just edited wb-input claude.md
```bash
# Mark it for aggregation
npm run mark-updated -- -FilePath "./components/wb-input/claude.md"

# Or tell AI
"Mark wb-input claude.md as updated"
```

### Scenario 2: How many files need processing?
```bash
npm run check-status
```

### Scenario 3: Update currentstatus.md now
**Tell AI**: "Aggregate changed claude.md files"

### Scenario 4: Rebuild everything
**Tell AI**: "Force full claude.md refresh"

⚠️ Warning: This reads 90+ files and takes 5-10 minutes

### Scenario 5: New component created
File automatically gets `<!-- STATUS: NEW -->` or add manually

---

## 📊 Status File Locations

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/docs/currentstatus.md` | Master status (auto-generated by AI) |
| `/components/*/claude.md` | Component development logs |
| `/tests/*/claude.md` | Test-related notes |
| `/CLAUDE.md` | Root-level project status |
| `/scripts/claude-status-results.json` | Last check results |

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "File not being aggregated"
- Check first line has correct marker syntax
- Verify marker has no extra spaces: `<!-- STATUS: UPDATED -->`
- Run `npm run check-status` to verify marker is detected

### "All files show as MISSING"
- Run first-time setup: `npm run init-markers`

### "currentstatus.md seems wrong"
- Tell AI: "Force full claude.md refresh"

### "Script won't run"
- Check PowerShell execution policy
- Run as admin if needed
- Verify scripts folder exists
