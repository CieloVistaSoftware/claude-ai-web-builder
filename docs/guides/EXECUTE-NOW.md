# 🚀 EXECUTE NOW - FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

## YOU'RE READY TO GO!

Everything is prepared. Now execute the reorganization with these simple steps:

---

## ⚡ QUICK EXECUTION

### Step 1: Open PowerShell
Press `Win + X` then select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)** or **Terminal (Admin)**

This will:
1. Create a Git backup automatically
2. Create a backup branch

## 🔄 AFTER EXECUTION

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: radical root reorganization - 45 files to 5"
```

### If Something Breaks
```powershell
# Instant rollback
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# OR switch to backup branch
git checkout backup/pre-reorganization-[timestamp]
```

---

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### If PowerShell Gives "Execution Policy" Error
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser
.\execute-now.ps1
```

### If Script Says "Not in Git Repository"
```powershell
cd C:\Users\jwpmi\Downloads\AI\wb
git status
```
This should show your Git status. Then run the script again.

### If You Have Uncommitted Changes
The script will warn you. Either:
1. Commit your changes first: `git add . && git commit -m "your message"`
2. Or use force flag: `.\execute-now.ps1 -Force`
