# HTML Refactor Compliance Report

## Summary
All non-component HTML files in `wb/` have been refactored to:
- Remove all inline JavaScript (JS) and move it to a `.js` file with the same base name as the HTML file.
- Update each HTML file to import the new JS file as a module using `<script type="module" src="..."></script>`.
- Enforce dark mode and ensure all styles are loaded from the `wb/styles/` folder (where applicable).

## Files Processed
- `final-ecosystem-test.html` → `final-ecosystem-test.js`
- `test-component-ecosystem.html` → `test-component-ecosystem.js`
- `test-color-bars.html` → `test-color-bars.js`
- `test-control-panel-events.html` → `test-control-panel-events.js`
- `test-simple-control-panel.html` → `test-simple-control-panel.js`
- `validation-report.html` → `validation-report.js`
- `symbol_table_builder.html` → `symbol_table_builder.js`

## Refactor Details
For each file:
- All inline `<script>` blocks were removed.
- The extracted JS was placed in a new file named after the HTML file (e.g., `foo.html` → `foo.js`).
- The HTML was updated to import the JS file as a module.
- Where present, inline CSS was moved to the `wb/styles/` folder and imported via `<link>`.
- Dark mode was enforced by ensuring the appropriate CSS classes or styles were present.

## Compliance
- **JS Extraction:** All inline JS is now in external `.js` files with matching base names.
- **Module Import:** All HTML files import their JS as modules.
- **Dark Mode:** All files use dark mode styling.
- **Styles Folder:** All styles are loaded from `wb/styles/` where applicable.

## Notes
- No component HTML files were modified.
- If any new HTML files are added, the same refactor pattern should be followed.
