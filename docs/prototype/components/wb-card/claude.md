## 🕒 RECENT ACTIVITY (October 11, 2025)
- Refactored wb-card.js to use a reactive pattern (signals/observables, declarative rendering, no imperative code) for full compliance with project rules.
- Updated compliance table and this claude.md accordingly.

### ✅ Duplicate Code Cleanup (December 19, 2024)
- **Issue**: CSS loading code duplicated across components
- **Status**: Already using WBComponentUtils pattern with fallback
- **Code Pattern**:
  ```javascript
  if (window.WBComponentUtils) {
      const cssPath = window.WBComponentUtils.getPath('wb-card.js', '../components/wb-card/') + 'wb-card.css';
      window.WBComponentUtils.loadCSS('wb-card', cssPath);
  } else {
      // Fallback CSS loading
  }
  ```
- **Result**: No changes needed - already follows best practices
