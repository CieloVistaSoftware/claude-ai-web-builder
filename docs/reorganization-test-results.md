## Impact of Project Reorganization

The successful test results confirm that our architectural reorganization has maintained full compatibility with all project features including:

1. **Component Systems** - All components continue to function correctly
2. **Dynamic Pages** - Navigation and content loading works as expected
3. **Theme System** - Theme generation and application is fully functional
4. **Server Integration** - Backend services continue to serve files correctly
5. **MCP Integration** - Model Context Protocol integration remains intact

This validates our approach of separating the codebase into clearly defined directories while maintaining cross-component functionality.

## Next Steps

With all tests passing, we can confidently:

1. Continue the migration of remaining files
2. Enable the clean-up phase in the reorganization script
3. Update any remaining documentation 
4. Focus on improving the architecture further with TypeScript migrations
