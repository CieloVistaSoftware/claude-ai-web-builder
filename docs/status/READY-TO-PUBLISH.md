🌊 What if we applied radio wave engineering to color design?

I just built a Wave-Based Color Harmony system that treats color as a wave phenomenon—combining traditional color theory with radio wave concepts:

✨ Phase Modulation (PM) - Hue oscillation
✨ Frequency Modulation (FM) - Sweeping effects
✨ Amplitude Modulation (AM) - Saturation pulsing
✨ Beat Patterns - Rhythmic variations
✨ Doppler Shift - Directional transitions
✨ Wave Superposition - Stable interference patterns

The result? Color palettes that are mathematically harmonious, perceptually pleasing, and dynamically adaptable.

Title: Wave-Based Color Harmony: Applying Radio Wave Theory to Color Design

I created a color harmony system that treats hue as a wave frequency, applying concepts from radio engineering (PM, FM, AM, beat patterns) to generate dynamic, mathematically harmonious color palettes.

Features:
- 9 harmony modes (traditional + wave-based)
- Real-time modulation engine
- Audio reactive mode
- Pure JavaScript, no dependencies

Would love feedback from the community!
